# FFR110_Set3_Task2_Problem2

This is an analytical solution for the assignment in FFR110_Computational_Biology mentioned in the title. 


If you want a much easier solution for part a), I'd suggest you to use the gamma function (I realized this after we had already solved it the hard way haha).

Hope it helps :) 

Good luck!
